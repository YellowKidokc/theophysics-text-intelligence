# Paper Snapshot Schema

Purpose: one-screen scientific triage for a paper, axiom page, proof page, or ISO page.

The snapshot is not the whole paper, the whole proof explorer, or a public marketing page. It answers:

> What is being claimed, what kind of claim is it, what supports it, what would break it, and why should a physicist keep reading?

## Required Boxes

1. Paper ID / Identity Strip
2. One-Sentence Claim
3. Claim Maturity Level
4. FACTS Snapshot
5. 7Q Mini Grid
6. Forward / Reverse Test
7. Evidence Bar
8. Kill Conditions
9. Not Claimed

All boxes should be scannable when closed. Deeper details can be expandable.

## Claim Maturity Ladder

```text
1 Metaphor
2 Analogy
3 Structural Correspondence
4 Formal Model
5 Machine-Checked Theorem
6 Empirical Support
7 Public Proof Claim
```

## UI Rule

The closed view must fit on one screen at desktop size. The expanded view may reveal:

- Full 7Q fields
- Full kill-condition test descriptions
- Evidence table
- Dependency chain
- Lean file links
- Claim audit rows

## Tone Rule

For physicists, the snapshot should lead with structure, falsifiability, and proof boundary. It should not lead with persuasion.
